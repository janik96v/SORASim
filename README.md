This repository contains additional material to the master thesis â€œHigh Fidelity UAV Simulation Tool for the Support of SORA Process Based Validation of Operational Flight Volume and Ground Risk Buffer" which was part of the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE). The aim of the master thesis is to use a high-fidelity UAV simulation in order to validate the size of the ground risk buffer and contingency volume for a UAV operation within the specific class according to EU Regulation 947/2019. The flight authorization permit is granted under the SORA methodology. 

The high-fidelity UAV simulation is based on open-source software and uses the Gazebo simulator, PX4 flight controller (SITL-Version), QGroundControl and Python using the MAVSDK library for communication via offboard control. In addition the AirSim simulator can be used to enable high quality rendering via Unreal Engine. For more information about the architecture of the simulator, see the thesis.
