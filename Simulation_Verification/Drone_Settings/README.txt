This Gazebo Model File and QGroundControl Settings was used for:

- 	Flying the experiments
- 	Containes moments of intera adapted to fit the changed mass of main body (5.33kg)
- 	maxRotVel changed so that rotor only makes 33.33N instead of 50N. 
	Was wrong because Typhoon is a hexacopter and needs less thrust per rotor than M300 as a quadcopter
